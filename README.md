# TracingSimPy

This repository is created to simulate typical radar tracking scenarios.
The repository is **currently under development** as a master's thesis project. 

The first goal is to create functional library to simulate single target tracking with adaptive revisit interval.
The simulator acts as a basis for tracking environment to be used in reinforcement learning (RL) applications.
The RL environment can be found from RadarGym repository.
