# TracingSimPy

This repository is created to be used to simulate typical radar tracking scenarios.
The repository is currently under deploiment as a master's thesis project. 

The first goal is to create functional library to simulate single target tracking with adaptive revisit interval.
The simulator acts as basis for tracking environment to be used in reinforcement learning (RL) applications.
The RL environment can be found from RadarGym repository.
